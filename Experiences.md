And finally, after 3 years of LeetCoding my time has come!
Background:

    I am engineer with about 8 years of coding and other software experience
    I fnished my university at 2007, so I didn't get to developing with the first chance
    I started solving problems on LeetCode and other resources since 2017 without prior experince of such type of coding
    Currently I have about 350 solved problems at LC, many of them solved several time because of long timeline
    About 20 drawn system designs
    I tried Amazon and Google a year ago with no luck and was hired by Yandex
    Yes, I currently located in Russia - so there will be a lot of fun with relocation and COVID situation

The process:

    Whole process took me about 3 months. All interviewers at FB are very loaded and each step took 2-5 week
    Initially I was asked to try as operations engineers (I have mixed with DevOps background), but in initial discussion I asked to treat me as a software engineer, so they switched me to another HR and we made one more round. After that we scheduled a screening round in about 3 weeks upfront.
    On the screening (45min) that were clear structured very standard tasks from LC. I solved about 2,5 of them. On the 3rd one the time was over and the interviewer was really happy that we went so far. The tasks were so easy that I didn’t get any mistakes at all. The 3rd one was just to spend some time.
    After the positive feedback I was asked to provide additional info about my leadership/mentorship/techleading experience. Yes, for FB it is very important for senior levels and I am especially happy about that - it’s boring just to write code and don’t understand other soft skill or architecture parts of the development. Also they didn’t have lower level vacancies for relocation at that time. With this info I secured the slot for a full interview round in 4-5 weeks.
    Full interview round was very standard for big companies. 4 rounds: 2 codings, 1 system design, 1 behavioural. Each round is about 45min and you have 15min break in between and it is fully remote
    In first coding I solved 1 question with versions follow up. That was not an LC problem, but it’s doable and not hard
    Second coding - 2 standard easy-medium LC questions. I finished them in 30 minutes and to proof test the last one because it looked like interviewer didn’t expect that
    Behavioural - I talked all the time without coding. Questions are pretty standard, but you should be prepared with answer-stories to them. Like the question of all the times: “Tell me about a project that you are most proud of”. I spoke there a lot - I spoke too much at that time.
    System design - because it is online you have different options how to draw, I chose draw.io, shared the link to it with the interviewer for download and shared my screen for real time drawing. In my case the system wasn’t standard (not Instagram, Whatsapp, Uber, etc), but it wasn’t hard and the interviewer didn’t expect that I would draw smth magical. It was distributed - yes, and if you know standard building blocks - you can do it. Just ask as many questions as possible upfront and write down the answers into drawing.
    In just about 2 days HR contacted me and gave me explained feedback. Which looked like: “Hire, but with follow up of Behavioural section”. I had some missing points - I talked too much, but not clear enough. Also there was some issues with the sound on the interviewer side. So - there is really great that FB gives you a second chance if one of the sections is good, but not good enough.
    So in 2 weeks I passed 2sn chance Behavioural. This time - spoke less, re-check that I was heard and this time it was like equal dialog. In the last 5-7min I was asked to solve easy coding problem.
    In 2 working days that was feedback with the hiring committee final decision to hire.

Tips:

    Never give up, it’s hard to solve prob

    lems. Fight with them until they defeat
    Differentiate questions from interviews and just for contests or to "break your brain".
    Get top interview questions and if you know the company - top question from the company (I bought LC premium for last months). It really helps you focus. And even from them - I didn’t see any hard problems from that top, maybe difficulty depends on location.
    Watch youtube system design videos and draw with them. I know all the building blocks upfront, but it’s difficult to draw from scratch and move like it’s expected and in time.
    In the preparation letters (or just google it) you will have a bunch of questions for behavioural round - try to make tesises for each of them and by using them - speak the full story. In my opinion, the broadly advertised STAR method is too heavy for each answer (or maybe I don’t know how to cook it), try to get to the point faster and concisely.

Offer:
I didn’t bargain about the offer. It was really standard for London E5 newcomers - I googled the exact same numbers on different sites and in my opinion these numbers are really good for a start. Also it includes a great relocation package - which means you move your home as painlessly as possible.

Thanks LC and everybody who is here. It was really a great journey

PS. Sorry for no exact code - NDA, etc.
